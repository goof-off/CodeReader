## Better to have

* Popover a  view for the function definition on tapping a symbol.
* Add comments/notes/bookmarks on a line. Maybe simply tapping the line number in the left pane to create some.
* Easier to tap the symbol.
* Visualize a jump graph, rather than just using the view controller's stack.
